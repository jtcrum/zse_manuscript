* Highlights
What is the main point of the paper? What problem is it addressing? What are the main insights?

* Introduction
Introduction needs more structure.  Start with background, identify the problem you want to address.

Zeolites are microporous and crystalline, natural to characterize by the sizes of the features present in the crystal.  Rings are one common type of feature widely reported and used, both to characterize a zeolite crystal and as descriptors of the individual tetrahedral sites of the zeolite.  Provide some historical perspective here....
- Rings have been used to identify feasible zeolite topologies cite:li-why-2014, to descirbe the similarity and differences between zeolites cite:curtis-statistical-2003, to identify sites or voids of catalytic relevance cite:li-first-principles-2018,kester-effects-2021, and as machine learning finger prints [will get citations for this] \red{need more thorough citing}

- Zeolites can naturally be represented using graph theory, where atoms are nodes, and bonds are edges. \red{REFS}
  - Sometimes in the literature, oxygen atoms are used as bridges instead of nodes, since they only connect to two T-sites
- \red{Refer to/use table below} Table 1 summarizes 
- Rings are defined as a close cycle traversing the T-site and oxygen atoms of the framework, and cannot be decomposed into smaller cycles by a shortcut cite:goetzke-properties-1991.
- A shortcut is defined as a path connecting two nodes of a cycle that is shorter than both the paths connecting those nodes along the cycle. 
- See Cref:fig:cha-labeled for example of rings
  - The pink highlighted cycle (1-2-3-17-20-14-15-16) is a 8-membered ring (8-MR)
  - The green highlighted cycle (14-20-12-13) is a 4-MR
  - The red outlined cycle following 3-4-18-19-20-17 is not an 6-MR because there is a shortcut connecting nodes 17 and 18.
  - Nodes 5-6-7-8-9 outlined in teal represent a path through the framework.

- Different methods exist to count rings present in a zeolite \red{Clarify this statement. IMO, the rings of a zeolite are well defined topologically; there can be no different methods to "count" them.  The total set can be "pruned" according to some rules.  They can be used to classify or characterize T-sites.  Whatever the case, strive to make the points clearly and precisely. }

- These methods return different sets of rings
- \red{Have to distinguish between rings associated with a Framework (column 3) and how rings are used to classify a code (columns 4 and 5)} Vertex symbols are the set of shortest paths connecting the 6 oxygen-oxygen pairs around a T-site cite:okeeffe-vertex-1997
- Shortest path rings count all the vertex symbol rings that pass through a T-site or an oxygen atom cite:sastre-topological-2009
- Or we can count all the rings that do not have a short cut cite:goetzke-properties-1991
- Differences in ring counts leads to differences in how we describe the topology of zeolites. Therefore, when discussing the rings in a zeolite it is important to also state which method of ring counting is used.
- Here we report an analysis of rings and T-sites in a large number of zeolite frameworks using Zeolite Simulation Environment, a Python package that implements an efficient algorithm presented by Goetzke and Klein cite:goetzke-properties-1991 for finding rings in arbitrary frameworks. \red{What is new here?}
- We compare the results \red{be more specific} of a number of common and new ring definitions applied to a large number of common zeolite frameworks.cite:li-first-principles-2018 \red{why this ref?}

\red{Introduction needs to foreshadow the important insights. We captured those in your abstract. They need to appear here too.}
* Software Description

- All of the frameworks listed on the IZA Database of zeolite structures cite:baerlocher-database-nodate are included in a database with ZSE
- These structures are Atomic Simulation Environment Atoms objects cite:larsen-atomic-2017, and can be used with any of the functions in ZSE
- ZSE also includes CIF tools to read structure files for frameworks not listed in the IZA website, such as hypothetical zeolites, and return an Atoms object that can be used with ZSE
- ZSE has 3 previously published rules for ring finding implemented
  - All cycles without a shortcut cite:goetzke-properties-1991
  - All shortest path cycles cite:sastre-topological-2009
  - Cycles that compose the vertex symbol for a T-site cite:okeeffe-vertex-1997
- We have also implemented a new rule that finds all rings with out a shortcut, but excludes rings that are made by traversing a stacked set of rings. \red{Have to define stacked ring.}
  - Figure showing example of 8-MR in the d6r of CHA and 14-MR in AFI
- Each of the rules: shortest path, vertex symbols, and our new rule are a subset of the no shortcuts rule
Process to find rings:
1. To find rings in a zeolite, ZSE makes a custom connectivity matrix for the Si and O atoms in the framework
2. We use NetworkX cite:hagberg-exploring-2008 to build a shortest path matrix for every atom pair in the zeolite framework
3. We then find all the rings up to some cutoff size base on the algorithm presented by Goetzke and Klein cite:goetzke-properties-1991
4. Depending on the rule chosen by the user, ZSE then removes rings from this list that don't meet the qualifications of the rule
5. ZSE returns a list of the rings found, a list of the atom indicies that compose each ring, Atoms objects for each ring that can be further analyzed or visualized by the user


* Results
- Ring counts frequency plots
  - Plot showing how many frameworks on the IZA contain each size ring found using the various ring counting methods
  - This highlights the differences in the ring rules, and shows that results will vary depending on rule.

#+caption: Number of IZA frameworks containing each size ring, using the various ring counting rules. [This will be updated with the Sastre method, vertex method, and the rings listed on  the IZA website. Currently the IZA does not show any ring data for the SVY framework, providing one less framework to count.  label:fig:ring-counts
file:../figures/completed-figures/ring-counts.pdf

- Number of unique T-sites
  - There are 1460 T-sites through all the frameworks listed on the IZA website.
  - We can characterize those T-sites by the rings that pass through them
  - Sastre did this, and called the list of rings, the ring index
  - If we do this using different rules for ring finding how do the results change?
    - See Cref:fig:unique-ts
  - Most common T-site ring index using Goetzke method is: 5_{6}\bullet10_{4} showing up 23 times through the IZA frameworks.
  - Most common T-site ring index using Crum method is: 4_{3}\bullet8_{4} showing up 31 times through the IZA frameworks.
    - Next most common T-site with Crum method is 5_{6}\bullet10_{4} showing up 25 times
  - This raises the question, if you want to use machine learning to correlate T-site rings to chemical properties, which ring method should you use?

#+caption: Number of unique T-sites when classified by the rings passing through them using varrious ring finding rules. label:fig:unique-ts
file:../figures/completed-figures/unique-ts.pdf

- Number of unique oxygen sites
  - We can repeat this method for the oxygen atoms in all the frameworks
  - Counting the symmetry distinct oxygen atoms in each framework on the IZA database leads to a total count of 3219
  - We can classify those oxygen atoms based on the rings that pass through them, using the various ring counting rules
  - Cref:fig:unique-os shows counts based on ring finding rules
  - The percentage of unique oxygen sites is much lower than the percentage of unique T-sites for every ring finding method

file:../figures/completed-figures/unique-os.pdf

- Reproduce the results from Sastre paper, show ring counts with the other rules, Cref:tab:ring-counts
  - Results in the Sastre column were found using ZSE but agree directly with the results shown by Sastre and Corma cite:sastre-topological-2009
  - This provides an in depth look at some of the frameworks and the differences in rings found by each rule.
  - Leads into the next section discussing the specific rings of CHA and pentasil that do or don't get counted by each rule.

\newpage

- These ring finding rules often find rings that are not commonly discussed in literature, and are not listed by the IZA
- These are classified as untabulated rings by Curtis and Deem cite:curtis-statistical-2003
- However it is possible that these rings are relevant for describing chemical, catalytic, or topological properties of zeolites
- Here we show an example of untabulated rings in the Chabazite framework
- Show the cage belts results for CHA, AFT, etc... and discuss how those rings don't show up in previous literature, Cref:fig:cha-rings
  - Looking at results for CHA in Cref:tab:ring-counts we see the Goetzke method finds 4_{3}\bullet6_{1}\bullet8_{6}\bullet12_{1}
  - This is different from the results in the Sastre paper cite:sastre-topological-2009, in that they only show 2 8-MRs and no 12-MRs
  - The extra 8-MRs result from cycles traversing nodes in both 6-MRs of the d6r
    - Crum rule removes these 8-MRs while still finding the 12-MR
    - Sastre rule does not find the 8-MRs in the d6r or the 12-MR
  - The 12-MR is a cycle that circumferences the CHA cage

#+caption: Chabazite framework with highlighted rings: 4-MR in green, 8-MR in pink, and 12-MR in purple. The 8-MR in the d6r and the 12-MR are rings not typically discussed in literature, Si atoms have been replaced with Al atoms to help identify those rings in the overall cage structure.. label:fig:cha-rings

- On the other end of the spectrum, there are cycles that would not be classified as a rings by the connectivity rules previously outlined that display properties similar to rings
- These shortcut containing cycles can display chemical and/or geometric properties consistent with rings, and are of interest to catalysis researchers even though they are not considered rings by connectivity rules
- One example is the 6-membered cycle referred to as the \alpha-6-MR in literature (Cref:fig:mfi-6) and is present in a number of frameworks including but not limited to  MOR, FER, MFI, and BEA cite:dedecek-siting-2012,bernauer-proton-2016, which is a potential location for Co^{2+} uptake when two Al atoms are 3rd nearest neighbor in the cycle. Similar to Co^{2+} uptake in 3NN Al atoms in 6-MRs in other frameworks such as CHA and AEI.
- This 6-membered cycle would not be considered a ring by any of the connectivity rules outlined here due to the shortcut splitting the cycle into two 5-MRs

* Conclusions
- \red{Rings of graph are well defined; here identify all rings up to XXX in YYY frameworks. Find that commonly reported (IZA) ring sizes miss certain rings.}


- The method used to find rings in a zeolite will provide different ring counts \red{unclear}
- When discussing rings in a zeolite it is import to disclose by which method those rings were found
- Using ZSE we can find rings based on various methods
- This provides a foundation for using ring fingerprints in machine learning models to correlate chemical properties and topology
