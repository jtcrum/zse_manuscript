	abstract = {Known zeolite structures have relatively few seven-membered rings. Previous quantum mechanical calculations suggest there is no particular energy penalty for sevenmembered rings. Predicted zeolite structures sampled from all possible symmetries also do not explain why there are so few observed seven-membered rings. Here, we analyze the ring size distributions of predicted structures as a function of energy and density. We show that predicted structures with low density, in the range where known zeolites exist, have relatively few seven-membered rings. It appears that the constraint of proximity to the low-density edge of predicted structures is what leads to a low probability of seven-membered rings. These results suggest that low-density predicted structures are similar to known zeolites and of greatest interest as new synthetic targets.},

Two kinds of averages are considered by taking into account the topologic and the crystallographic nature of the T sites. The framework distortions upon isomorphic substitution can be analyzed from the results of computational calculations or experimental data. The coordination sequences of the T atoms and the vertex symbols are also calculated by the program.

We assessed the quality of each descriptor by machine-learning the molar energy and volume for each hypothetical framework in the dataset. We have found that a SOAP representation with a cutoff length of 6 Å, which goes beyond nearneighbor tetrahedra, best describes the structural diversity in the Deem database by capturing relevant interatomic correlations. Kernel principal component analysis shows that SOAP maintains its superior performance even when reducing its dimensionality to those of the classical descriptors and that the first three kernel principal components capture the main variability in the dataset, allowing a 3D point cloud visualization of local environments in the Deem database. This “cloud atlas” of local environments was found to show good correlations with the contribution of a given motif to the density and stability of its parent framework. Local volume and energy maps constructed from the SOAP/machine learning analyses provide new images of zeolites that reveal smooth variations of local volumes and energies across a given framework and correlations between the contributions to volume and energy associated with each atom-centered environment.},

	abstract = {Crystalline porous materials have a variety of uses, such as for catalysis and separation. Identifying suitable materials for a given application can, in principle, be done by screening material databases. Such a screening requires automated high-throughput analysis tools that calculate structural properties for all materials contained in a database so they can be compared with search queries, grouped or classiﬁed. One important aspect of the structural analysis of materials such as zeolites and metal organic frameworks is the investigation of the geometrical parameters describing pores. Here, we present algorithms and tools to efﬁciently calculate some of these important parameters. Our tools are based on the Voronoi decomposition, which for a given arrangement of atoms in a periodic domain provides a graph representation of the void space. The resulting Voronoi network is analyzed to obtain the diameter of the largest included sphere and the largest free sphere, which are two geometrical parameters that are frequently used to describe pore geometry. Accessibility of nodes in the network is also determined for a given guest molecule and the resulting information is later used to retrieve dimensionality of channel systems as well as in Monte Carlo sampling of accessible surfaces and volumes. The presented algorithms are implemented in a software tool, Zeo++, which includes a modiﬁed version of the Voro++ library. We present example applications of our algorithms and tools using zeolite frameworks currently listed in the Atlas of Zeolite Frameworks.},

	abstract = {The arrangement of framework Al heteroatoms in zeolite lattices inﬂuences the energetics of proton siting and thus the distribution of protons among crystallographically-distinct oxygen atoms and void environments, as shown here for H-CHA zeolites of ﬁxed bulk Al content (Si/Al = 15) but varying amounts of proximal Al sites (Al-O-(Si-O)x-Al, x = 1,2) in a six-membered ring (6-MR). Stretching vibrations of Brønsted acidic OH groups give rise to composite infrared (IR) features whose shapes and integrated intensities are invariant with temperature (448–748 K) on H-CHA zeolites containing predominantly 6-MR isolated Al sites. In sharp contrast, IR peak shapes change and integrated OH areas decrease reversibly with increasing temperature on H-CHA zeolites containing 6-MR paired Al sites (quantiﬁed by Co2+ titration). Periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the four distinct OH conﬁgurations at an isolated Al site exhibit distinct vibrational frequencies and molar absorptivities, but are isoenergetic (within 10 kJ molÀ1) rendering equilibrium proton populations and OH IR spectra insensitive to temperature. In contrast, paired proton conﬁgurations differ in energy by up to {\textasciitilde}40 kJ molÀ1, with higher energy conﬁgurations having lower oscillator strengths; as a result, increasing temperatures shift proton populations toward higher energy conﬁgurations that result in a decrease in composite OH IR peak areas. First-order rate constants of protolytic propane cracking (748 K, per H+) are {\textasciitilde}12Â higher on paired than isolated protons, despite similar apparent activation energies, reﬂecting apparent activation entropies that are less negative at paired proton sites. Propane cracking rates (748 K, per g) decrease linearly with Na+ content upon partial titration of H+ sites in CHA zeolites containing 6-MR isolated sites, but decrease more strongly at low Na+ contents on CHA zeolites containing 6-MR paired sites, consistent with experimental OH IR spectra and DFT calculations evincing the preferential exchange of Na+ at 6-MR paired Al sites. These conclusions about proton proximity, founded on the interrogation of well-deﬁned and characterized CHA zeolite samples by experiment and theory, provide new insights regarding its consequences for the temperature sensitivity of OH IR spectra and protolytic alkane cracking rates in Brønsted acidic zeolites. The ﬁnding that proximal proton sites accelerate high-temperature alkane activation turnovers via non-polar transition states represents a mechanistically distinct extension of our prior reports, wherein proximal protons accelerate low-temperature alkanol dehydration turnovers via polar transition states stabilized by hydrogen bonding interactions, heralding the catalytic diversity among zeolites containing different framework Al arrangements.},
